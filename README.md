## Usage

Slides content can be easily read right on GitHub in the [decks](decks) folder.
You can also build slides and read them in a browser.

## Build slides

This project uses [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) framework and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. To build and run slides on your local run:

```
git clone https://github.com/adaltas/ece-devops-course.git
cd ece-devops-course
npm install
npm run serve
```

Then open in a browser `http://localhost:9000` (could be another port number).
